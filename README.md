# EncryptIT
![assets/banner.jpg](./assets/banner.jpg) 

After getting inspired from the Enigma machine, I developed this **Route Cipher** based algorithm. Its processing & working varies a lot than the actual enigma machine. _EncryptIt_ has been successfully integrated with two (2) more applications, as well.  

## Basic Info  
1. This project is available in 2 different languges i.e. Java and Python
2. Here if you just want to access the Encryption/Decryption utility, you can use Jar (runnable) files for the same
3. The Pyhton Version of Same Software is implemented into a Chat Room App, that is available at:
[Chatroom Application in Python](https://github.com/ravi-prakash1907/Chatroom-Application)

## Executing the Encryption alone through terminal

Initially run the server
```java -jar serverMain.jar```

Now, the client can perform its job.  
Launch the client application using following command:  
```java -jar clientMain.jar```
